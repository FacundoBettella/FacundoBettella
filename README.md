### Hi there, I'm Facundo Bettella Iunnissi!ðŸ‘‹

As a Psychologist, i learned the value of expression, the particular logic of each person, and the productive importance of group dynamics.
As a full stack developer, I understood the importance of technology in the active transformation of society. Also as through some lines of code together with applied creativity we can build entire worlds.

Now, who am I? 
A restless person with the ability to adapt to change, always willing to learn from others and then be able to transmit knowledge.
My Favorite Axiom: "When One Teaches, Two Learn" -Robert A. Heinlein.
